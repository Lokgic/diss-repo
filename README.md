# Deliberative Bayesianism: Abduction, Reflection, and the Weight of Evidence

n this dissertation, I defend the thesis that an epistemic judgment of probability must be interpreted against the background of the context of inquiry in which it is made: in the abductive context, judgments of probability are matters of decision, made strategically in ser vice to the investigative goal of the inquirer ; in deduction, probabilities are derived based on the premises chosen in abduction, in order to explicate the implied commit- ments the agent may incur from those decisions; during the inductive stage, the inquirer is expected to conduct her empirical investigation in a deliberate manner, in accordance with the assertions and decisions she made during abduction and deduction, collectively referred to as the deliberative context. I set the stage by proposing a pragmatist reading of Bas van Fraassen's Reflection Prin- ciple and his voluntarist interpretation of assertions of degrees of beliefs as performa- tive locutions to express the intention to undertake a proportional epistemic commit- ment. I argue for a refiment of this view that I call deliberativism, which introduces an abductive dimension to understand the normative force that regulates these epistemic judgments. I then argue that decisions made in the context of abduction have inferential repercussions on the validity of inductive inference. In particular, I situate deliberativism in the context of statistical inference by critically examining a problem in the literature called optional stopping, which occurs when the experimenter's intention to stop can ma- nipulate the statistical significance of the data. The last chapter explores the Pericean idea of deductive reasoning as the strategic interrogation of a provisionally chosen hypothesis by focusing on J. M. Keynes' notion of the weight of evidence
