\section{Motivation and Outline}

Historically, empiricism is often associated with a flavor of
foundationalism that holds that empirical evidence must in some sense be
untainted - if experience is to serve as the objective foundation of
knowledge, it must be unsullied by our attitudes, beliefs, and values.
It is without a doubt motivated by a conception of rationality familiar
to philosophers, because of Descartes' method of doubt:

Reason now leads me to think that I should hold back my
assent from opinions which are not completely certain and indubitable
just as carefully as I do from those which are patently false.\cite{med}
\end{quote}
