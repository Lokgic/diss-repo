\title{Deliberative Bayesianism:\\Abduction, Reflection, and the Weight of Evidence}

\abstract
In this dissertation, I defend the thesis that an epistemic judgment of
probability must be interpreted against the background of the
\emph{context of inquiry} in which it is made: in the abductive context,
judgments of probability are matters of \emph{decision}, made
strategically in service to the investigative goal of the inquirer; in
deduction, probabilities are \emph{derived} mathematically based on the
premises chosen in abduction in order to explicate the implied
commitments the agent may incur from those decisions; during the
inductive stage, the inquirer is expected to conduct her empirical
investigation \emph{deliberately}, in accordance with the assertions and
decisions she made during abduction and induction, collectively referred
to as the \emph{deliberative context}.

To develop my position, I set the stage by proposing a pragmatist reading of Bas van Fraassen's Reflection Principle and his \emph{voluntarist} interpretation of assertions of degrees of beliefs as performative locutions to express the intention to undertake a proportional epistemic commitment. I argue for a refinement of this view that I call \emph{deliberativism}, which introduces an abductive dimension in order to understand the normative force that regulates these epistemic judgments. I then elaborate on my claim that decisions made in the context of abduction have inferential repercussions on the validity of inductive inference. In particular, I situate deliberativism in the context of statistical inference by critically examining a problem in the literature called \emph{optional stopping}, which is used to demonstrate how the experimenter's intention to stop can manipulate the statistical significance of the data. The last chapter explores the Pericean idea of deductive reasoning as the strategic interrogation of a provisionally chosen hypothesis by focusing on J. M. Keynes' notion of \emph{the weight of evidence}.
